Nice and Easy Canon EOS Rebel T3 DSLR Camera I've been using SLRs for 35 years +.  Decided it was time to go digital.  Very satisfied with my purchase!  And it cost alot less than my Dad's $1000 + digital!

Nice and Easy Canon EF 75-300MM F/4-5.6 III Lens I'm extremely happy with my purchase and will definitely continue shopping with this company!!!

Nice and Easy Canon EOS Rebel T3 DSLR Camera I owned a Pentax DSLR before this one.  The EOS is much easier to use and had all the features that the Pentax lacked.  The lens stabilizer is  a great addition.  I also have begun to use the movie recording aspect on it.  For the package that I bought came with a nice zoom lens along with the one already installed.  The cost of the whole package was more than worth it.

Nice and Easy Canon EOS Rebel T3 DSLR Camera My first digital EOS camera

Excellent for support department My people were losing their notebook chargers as fast as they lose their smartphone chargers. It was getting pricey to continue to replace them with original manufacturer chargers (HP &amp; Lenovo). This charger is half the price, but just as good. It works with all the notebooks we have at our site. I highly recommend.

Excellent for support department Im the support guy for our small company and having many different types of laptops means different types of power adapters for those machines. This one is very good. Works with all our machines, Fujitsu, Toshiba, HP, & Dell. Really an essential for a support department having to deal with many different laptops.

Excellent for support department My people were losing their notebook chargers as fast as they lose their smartphone chargers. It was getting pricey to continue to replace them with original manufacturer chargers (HP &amp; Lenovo). This charger is half the price, but just as good. It works with all the notebooks we have at our site. I highly recommend.

Excellent for support department Im the support guy for our small company and having many different types of laptops means different types of power adapters for those machines. This one is very good. Works with all our machines, Fujitsu, Toshiba, HP, & Dell. Really an essential for a support department having to deal with many different laptops.

    DSLR cameras are fast-focusing, allow you to take multiple photos quickly, and compose sharp images in nearly any light. With a precision viewfinder and image sensors that are more than 8X larger than smartphone sensors, DSLR cameras let you take pictures that are more detailed and stay sharp when resized. DSLRs also allow you to record crisp HD video, even in low light, so you wont miss a moment of your childs first music recital. If you tell stories with motion capture, the large image sensors let you record movies with a wide selection of interchangeable lenses for beautiful diffused backgrounds - all at the push of a button.
