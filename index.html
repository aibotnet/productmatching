        Tool   which  compare  our  product  with  product  listed   at different  sites  and  extract   reviews  for products of  our  organization . I used  python  and   it's libraries  for developing this tool.  After extracting reviews tool calculate   review  rating and generate the points(topics) which   is best   suited   feature for a particular product 
        depending upon the reviews we are getting.

          <font face="Arial" size="3">The project is about extracting REVIEWS for as many products as possible falling under different categories. The project concentrates on the products shown at Nextag. For sameple i choosed 100 products.For All  products, there are no reviews and hence no Wize rating because product rating is calculated based on the customer reviews.Product rating is the rating calculated by the company for any product and rating of a product has a huge impact on the customer decision regarding that product and influences the customer opinion in a good way.</font></br>

          <font face="Arial" size="3" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">So, content-matching techniques were required using which we can match our products on any e-commerce site and then can extract the reviews from that site. In this way, reviews for more and more products can be gathered and displayed on our website which not only helps the customers in deciding whether they want to make a purchase or not but also helps the company in calculating the rating of the product which influences the customer decision a lot. The idea is not to be dependent on the urls provided by the merchants for reviews but to come up with a technique which can extract reviews from anywhere on the internet.</font></br>
